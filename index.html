        <h3>Who We Are</h3>
        <p>ECOYST is a forward-thinking, eco-driven brand founded in <strong>2025</strong> with a mission to transform everyday food waste into powerful, natural compost. We are dedicated to enriching soil, supporting plant health, and promoting sustainable living.</p>

        <h3>Our Story</h3>
        <p>ECOYST began with a simple realization: while food waste cannot be entirely eliminated, it <em>can</em> be transformed into something valuable. Instead of letting organic matter pollute landfills, we return it to the earth in its purest, most useful form — nutrient-rich compost produced via machine-assisted, chemical-free decomposition.</p>

        <h3>Our Commitment to Quality</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Controlled machine processing and strict quality checks</li>
          <li>Zero chemical additives and zero contamination</li>
          <li>Batch-wise testing to ensure consistent nutrient value</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Our Commitment to Sustainability</h3>
        <p>We reduce food waste by converting household food scraps into nutrient-rich organic compost, promote circular-economy practices, and support soil restoration.</p>

        <h3>Made With Hygiene & Care</h3>
        <p>Every step is designed to maintain clean handling, proper temperatures, and secure packaging — producing a safe, hygienic product suitable for homes, nurseries, and farms.</p>

        <h3>Our Vision</h3>
        <p>To create a sustainable world where organic waste becomes a resource, not a burden.</p>

        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
        <p>Since food waste cannot be completely stopped, our mission is to repurpose it responsibly — reduce waste, nourish the earth, and encourage greener lifestyles through natural composting solutions.</p>

        <h3>USP</h3>
        <p><strong>ECOYST is the first premium, high-efficacy compost that directly converts household food scraps into powerful plant nutrition — enabling consumers to participate actively in the circular economy.</strong></p>
